## Quick start

This project was made for 2022 NTU Remote Sensing & Geospatial Information Analysis And Application.  
There are two sections for in this project, ConvLSTM for windspeed time-series prediction and CNN for cyclone intensity prediction.  
:exclamation: You need GPU for this project, especially for ConvLSTM :exclamation:

- Instruction 1
- Instruction 2
- Instruction 3
