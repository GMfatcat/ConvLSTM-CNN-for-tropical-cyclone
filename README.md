## Quick start

This project was made for 2022 NTU Remote Sensing & Geospatial Information Analysis And Application.  
There are two sections for in this project, ConvLSTM for windspeed time-series prediction and CNN for cyclone intensity prediction.  
:exclamation: You need GPU for this project, especially for ConvLSTM :exclamation:

- Section 1: ConvLSTM ---> See #.ipynb# in Section 1 folder
- Section 1: CNN ---> See #.ipynb# in Section 2 folder
- Project Flow Chart as below
